# Pomodoro Timer Component

The Pomodoro Timer Component is a versatile, customizable web component designed to integrate a Pomodoro technique timer into web applications. It supports the standard Pomodoro technique cycles, including work periods (pomodoros), short breaks, and long breaks, with customization options for each duration and the cycle count.

## Deisgn Considerations

- **Dynamic State Updates**: Utilizes JavaScript Proxy for state management, allowing for reactive updates to the user interface as the timer state changes.
- **Modular Design**: Encapsulated in a class, making it easy to instantiate multiple timer instances on a single page with independent configurations.
- **Event-Driven Interactions**: The component employs an event-driven architecture for handling user interactions, decoupling the UI logic from the application logic. This approach simplifies the addition of new features and maintenance, as the core functionality is not tightly coupled with event handling.
